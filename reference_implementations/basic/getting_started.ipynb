    "``CyclOps`` has a few core packages that support functionality used for evaluation and monitoring. We will learn a bit more about the packages which we will use in today's workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``data`` - The ``data`` package supports loading and processing data into features for your ML model. More importantly, it supports slicing of data across sub-groups which can be pretty useful for evaluating your ML model across patient subpopulations.\n",
    "2. ``evaluate`` - The ``evaluate`` package supports evaluation of your ML model. The package contains a ``metrics`` sub-package which supports common ML performance metrics such as ``Accuracy``, ``Sensitivity`` and ``Specificity``. Furthermore, the ``evaluate`` package also allows calculating fairness metrics which can be used to compare performance of sub-groups with respect to a reference group.\n",
    "3. ``report`` - The ``report`` package supports the creation of model monitoring reports. The package allows users to customize the reports to their use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few packages that support ML model development and benchmarking:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ``models`` - The ``models`` package contains baseline model implementations\n",
    "using `scikit-learn`, `xgboost` and `pytorch` libraries. The package allows the user to easily train and evaluate models.\n",
    "5. ``tasks`` - The ``tasks`` package contains a few classes that implement classification tasks. These can be used for classification using tabular or image data, and are used to demonstrate example use cases.\n",
    "6. ``utils`` - The ``utils`` package contains useful utility functions for logging, development, saving and loading data."
